#StudyPlanner

This skeleton program runs a scenario of a Student creating a checklist to help
plan their work on various tasks.

Run Main.java located in /Controllers/ and the program will lead
you through the next steps in the Command Line.

All .java files are located in their relevant Clean Architecture
categories to match our CRC cards.

Thanks!
