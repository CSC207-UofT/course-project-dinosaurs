#StudyPlanner

This  program runs a scenario of a Student managing a number of checklists to help
plan their work on various tasks.

If you would like some example Checklists and Tasks to work with, run ReadWriterTest. 

Run Controllers.MainGUI.java located in /Controllers/. A file directory browser window will
appear where you can load any <br> 
saved Checklists from disk (located in the program directory).

All .java files are located in their relevant Clean Architecture
categories to match our CRC cards.

Thanks!
