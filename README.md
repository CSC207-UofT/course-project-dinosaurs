#StudyPlanner

This program is a study planner which was designed to help a student manage their school work. It allows 
the user to store their tasks in a checklist and create a study block which allots study time to their
current tasks.

To begin, run MainGUI located in /Controllers. The steps to using our program is as follows:

  1. Create a checklist. This can be done by clicking the "Manage Checklists" button on the main menu 
  and then "Create New Checklist." 
  
  2. Add a task. Cycle to the checklist you want to edit by using the "<" and ">" buttons. Then click
  "Add Task" and input the relevant information.
  
  3. Create a study block. Return to the main menu and then click on "Manage Study Blocks". From here,
  click on "Create New Study Block" and select which checklist(s) you'd like to study with. Select how
  long you'd like to study for and how you'd like the study block to be sorted.
  
  4. Study!

Additonal functions:
 
Checklists can be sorted according to due date, length, subjective importance and weight. This can be changed
in the Checklist Manager screen. 

As you finish tasks, you can mark a task as complete from the Checklist Manager menu which will remove it 
from its checklist. To see a history of your completed tasks, you can click on "View Completed Tasks". 
 
Study blocks can be exported to .ics files which are saved to your current directory. This can be done by
clicking on "Export Study Block" in the Study Block Manager screen.
 
If you'd like to change how the study blocks are broken up, go to "Preferences" from the main menu and
click "Set Study Method". From here, you can customize the break and active study intervals.

Note: You may have to use the "<" and ">" buttons to refresh the list view after adding a checklist or task.

Happy Studying!
