#StudyPlanner

This  program runs a scenario of a Student managing a number of checklists to help
plan their work on various tasks.

If you would like some example Checklists and Tasks to work with, run ChecklistReadWriterTest. 

Run Controllers.MainGUI.java located in /Controllers/. You can create new Tasks and Checklists <br>
in the Manage Checklists screen, or load existing Tasks, Checklists, and Study Blocks on startup <br>
if they have been previously saved when the program was run. <br>
After loading, you may need to use the '<' and '>' to update the display.

All .java files are located in their relevant Clean Architecture
categories to match our CRC cards.

Thanks!
