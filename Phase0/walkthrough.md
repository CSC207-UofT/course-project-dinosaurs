#Walkthrough
To form a schedule of their lectures and assignments, the user has to begin by logging into their account and entering their preferred study method and the time they have, as prompted by Main. They will also be asked to add new other tasks they need to complete. Main will create Student and CmdLineUI and show the student a list of the tasks they are yet to complete. The user will need to input information about tasks they need to do like upcoming tests, assignments, homework, deadlines and provide their weightage and priority which would be contained in Task. Main will call CmdLineUI and TaskManager to sort the tasks left based on priority and Checklist will then hold an arraylist of all these complete and incomplete tasks. StudyBlock incorporates Checklist and StudyMethod, holding them in an arraylist. This sorted list will be returned to Main. Information about their preferred study method will be held in StudyMethod. Main will call CmdLineUI so the student can choose their preferred study method for the session. A new StudyBlock is created with the Checklist and StudyMethod. The StudyBlock is then printed by Presenter.
