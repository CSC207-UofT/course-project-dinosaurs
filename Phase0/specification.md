#Specification
Students will start by logging in and providing their preferred study method and how long they want to study for. Students will be given different options of study methods to choose from such as Pomodoro, which is duration-based or a priority-based study schedule. Running the project prompts the student to enter information about the daily and weekly tasks they have to do for university such as assignments, homework, etc. Students are asked to enter their lecture, tutorial, and office hour schedule. Tasks are created to hold assignments, homework, and other things the student wishes to complete. They hold information on the weightage of the task, the due date, the priority with which the student wants to complete it, and whether the task is complete or incomplete. While running, the program creates and organizes study blocks according to the student’s preferred method of study. Users can decide whether to do tasks based on their due date or priority (the student will assign a number between 1-5 to show which tasks should be prioritized). The program will also keep track of dates, due dates, and missed deadlines. The program should be able to organize the student’s study schedule based on which tasks they have left and how long they wish to study for.
